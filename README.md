Simple symmetric encryption script to be used with the Hexchat IRC client.

The goal with this project was to as simple as possible add symmetric encryption between two or more IRC users who shares a common password file. To avoid using external python libraries the script uses the openssl-commandline-client for encryption and decryption.
